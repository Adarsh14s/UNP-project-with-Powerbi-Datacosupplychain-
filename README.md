# UNP-project-with-Powerbi-Datacosupplychain-

Completed the project as a part of my Power BI Internship with United Network of Professionals(UNP)

Description of the Project:- The dataset for which the analysis was made is a Supply Chain database. Firstly, to this database transformation was done for the date columns in order to make the date format uniform throughout the date column. After which KPI calculations were done based on different metrices and dimensions that were present in the dataset.The KPIs are Total revenue,Total cost,Total profit,Cost to revenue ratio,Profit to revenue ratio,Average order value,Average number of products per order,Average purchase price,Total quantity of products ordered.These KPIs were calculated using DAX.After calculating the KPIs, created a dashboard to know e-commerce performance by time and top 5 best performing products.Various charts such as line chart,stacked column chart,pie chart were used and slicers of order date and Country were in the dashboard for an intricate understanding of the dataset.Through these charts various insights were gathered.

Key Highlights: 1.Contributed to the creation of sophisticated KPIs and dynamic, interactive powerbi interfaces. 2.Diligently engaged in building a data model. 3.Used DAX to perform data transformations and computations for precise reporting and analysis.
